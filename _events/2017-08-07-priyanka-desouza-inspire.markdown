<h3>Priyanka D'souza</h3>

Our first speaker is Priyanka DeSouza, an Alumnus of IIT Bombay, she passed out in the year 2013 with a Dual degree, from the Department of Energy Science and Engineering. She secured the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford to pursue an MS, followed by which she did an MBA, also from Oxford and worked on a pricing strategy for a community energy service company. She then worked with UNEP(United Nations Environment Program), on setting up a low-cost air network in schools in Nairobi, Kenya. She was then recruited by the MIT Seseable City Lab, where she has been working with NASA on integrating the ground based air quality measurements with satellite data. She is also a contributing author to the book 'Drawdown' where she specifically examined the climate and financial benefits for different levels of adoption of micro wind turbines, roof top solar PV and roof-top solar water heating. She accomplished all this at the age of just 27, and she is going to start pursuing a PhD in MIT this year.
