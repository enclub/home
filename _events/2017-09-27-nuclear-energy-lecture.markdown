<h3>Lecture on COP 21</h3>
By- Prof. Suneet Singh

<h6>"Did you know that Nuclear Energy is much safer than we think?"</h6>

Energy club presents<br/>

A Lecture on "Nuclear Energy" by Prof Suneet Singh
The talk will cover the basic difference between nuclear bombs and reactors,
why reactors can never explode like bombs due to their inherent
configuration. 
You will also get to know the fundamental concepts of a pressurized water reactor (PWR),
boiling water reactor (BWR), pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR), Fast
Breeder Reactor (FBR) etc. 
The methods by which these reactors sustain fission reactions are explained.
A brief discussion on the future prospects of nuclear energy in India and the 
world is also part of this talk.
